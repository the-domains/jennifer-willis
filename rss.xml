            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Atmosphere of Venus Is More Terrifying Than We Imagined</h1><p>Add this to the list of reasons Venus is a blistering hellscape: not only is the surface hot enough to melt lead, not only will the sulfuric acid rainstorms burn gaping holes in your partially-melted spaceship, it's got a monstrous electric wind that appears to have helped strip all the water out of the atmosphere.</p><img src="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--vNhF5JIc--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_450,q_80,w_800/w49ivzf7vezdubzy0ayw.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>It Looks Like Pluto Has a Liquid Water Ocean</h1><p>For a frigid little space rock at the ass-end of the solar system, Pluto is full surprises. Ice volcanoes, hazy skies, vast plains of churning nitrogen, what's next? Just maybe, a subsurface ocean. Perhaps the most incredible discovery of the New Horizons Pluto encounter last summer was that the former ninth planet is geologically active, with widespread evidence of tectonic activity across its icy surface.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0da385c1de5e14d470d86d1cfec74c87/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kinja-img.com%2Fgawker-media%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fs--oquY4QP5--%2Fc_fill%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_450%2Cq_80%2Cw_800%2Fjsnr1wspnkxiyfphectp.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A scientific defense of science fiction - From the Mixed-Up Files...</h1><p>One day when I was growing up, over dinner at a friend's house, his parents told me they'd read some of the stories I wrote for fun. They thought I had real talent. I might even be a published author someday - if only I would stop wasting my time with all those spaceships and aliens.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b495226f3387c5940ad36156a2ff00dc/croprotate.jpeg?cropheight=1332&cropwidth=2000&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-images-1.medium.com%2Fmax%2F2000%2F1*Ya9QKNbUp8n4PtGsZ_87FQ.jpeg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
