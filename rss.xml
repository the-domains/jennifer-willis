            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Traces of Ancient Mega-Tsunamis Discovered on Mars</h1><p>Mars once featured a vast ocean that covered its northern hemisphere. New evidence suggests this Martian sea experienced at least two "mega-tsunamis" that were triggered by meteor impacts. Traces of these cataclysmic events can still be seen on the Martian surface, and they could still contain traces of ancient life.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4f6e927454b09c9e21fd53e86532187d/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kinja-img.com%2Fgawker-media%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fs--43Fi2bO---%2Fc_fill%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_450%2Cq_80%2Cw_800%2Fjji3t24ct0yz4awg5rcg.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>It Looks Like Pluto Has a Liquid Water Ocean</h1><p>For a frigid little space rock at the ass-end of the solar system, Pluto is full surprises. Ice volcanoes, hazy skies, vast plains of churning nitrogen, what's next? Just maybe, a subsurface ocean. Perhaps the most incredible discovery of the New Horizons Pluto encounter last summer was that the former ninth planet is geologically active, with widespread evidence of tectonic activity across its icy surface.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0da385c1de5e14d470d86d1cfec74c87/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kinja-img.com%2Fgawker-media%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fs--oquY4QP5--%2Fc_fill%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_450%2Cq_80%2Cw_800%2Fjsnr1wspnkxiyfphectp.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A scientific defense of science fiction - From the Mixed-Up Files...</h1><p>One day when I was growing up, over dinner at a friend's house, his parents told me they'd read some of the stories I wrote for fun. They thought I had real talent. I might even be a published author someday - if only I would stop wasting my time with all those spaceships and aliens.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b495226f3387c5940ad36156a2ff00dc/croprotate.jpeg?cropheight=1332&cropwidth=2000&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-images-1.medium.com%2Fmax%2F2000%2F1*Ya9QKNbUp8n4PtGsZ_87FQ.jpeg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
