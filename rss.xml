But The Martian, opening October 2, offers a mostly realistic view of conditions astronauts might encounter on Mars.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Realism Makes 'The Martian' One Of The Greatest Sci-Fi Films Of All Time</h1><p>It almost feels wrong to label The Martian as science fiction. Based on the book that computer programmer Andy Weir researched for three years, the movie feels like it could happen in real life any day now. You'll find no suspended animation, jump drives, or wormholes in this flick-just technologies that NASA is already using or could develop in the near future.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How scientifically accurate is The Martian?</h1><p>Overall it's a very good movie, and while there are mistakes in it, it is the first genuine Mars movie. It is the first movie that attempts to be realistic and that is actually about human beings grappling with the problems of exploring Mars, as opposed to various movies set on Mars that are essentially either shoot 'em ups or horror films. It does not engage in fantasy: no monsters, no magic, no Nazis.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/bc8331b3e314764be52945c0993fc0a7/croprotate.jpeg?cropheight=631&cropwidth=1200&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.guim.co.uk%2Fimg%2Fstatic%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F10%2F6%2F1444122986789%2Fe9e57c11-35e0-4d49-a618-588796aa3655-2060x1236.jpeg%3Fw%3D1200%26h%3D632%26q%3D55%26auto%3Dformat%26usm%3D12%26fit%3Dcrop%26bm%3Dnormal%26ba%3Dbottom%252Cleft%26blend64%3DaHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNi8wNy9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n%26s%3Daf1ebcfcc6e2e91af594fb1950a570fd&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
