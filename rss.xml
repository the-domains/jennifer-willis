            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Realism Makes 'The Martian' One Of The Greatest Sci-Fi Films Of All Time</h1><p>It almost feels wrong to label The Martian as science fiction. Based on the book that computer programmer Andy Weir researched for three years, the movie feels like it could happen in real life any day now. You'll find no suspended animation, jump drives, or wormholes in this flick-just technologies that NASA is already using or could develop in the near future.</p></article>]]></description>
