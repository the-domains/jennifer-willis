  Scientists say it looks like the asteroid -- called 2016 HO3 -- has been out
  there for about 50 years and isn't going away anytime soon. "Our calculations
  indicate 2016 HO3 has been a stable quasi-satellite of Earth for almost a
  century, and it will continue to follow this pattern as Earth's companion for
  centuries to come," said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for Near-Earth
  Object Studies.
