  It almost feels wrong to label The Martian as science fiction. Based on the
  book that computer programmer Andy Weir researched for three years, the movie
  feels like it could happen in real life any day now. You'll find no suspended
  animation, jump drives, or wormholes in this flick-just technologies that NASA
  is already using or could develop in the near future.
