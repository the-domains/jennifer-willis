  Mars once featured a vast ocean that covered its northern hemisphere. New
  evidence suggests this Martian sea experienced at least two "mega-tsunamis"
  that were triggered by meteor impacts. Traces of these cataclysmic events can
  still be seen on the Martian surface, and they could still contain traces of
  ancient life.
