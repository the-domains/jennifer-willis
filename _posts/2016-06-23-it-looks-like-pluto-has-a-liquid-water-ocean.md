  For a frigid little space rock at the ass-end of the solar system, Pluto is
  full surprises. Ice volcanoes, hazy skies, vast plains of churning nitrogen,
  what's next? Just maybe, a subsurface ocean. Perhaps the most incredible
  discovery of the New Horizons Pluto encounter last summer was that the former
  ninth planet is geologically active, with widespread evidence of tectonic
  activity across its icy surface.
