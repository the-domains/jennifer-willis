  YouTube/20th Century Fox I have seen the film adaptation of Andy Weir's
  best-selling novel " The Martian," and I can deliver my review in one sentence
  with zero spoilers: sci-fi movie made within my lifetime. (A necessary caveat
  because nothing can touch the 1970s and 1980s "Star Wars" in my mind.)
