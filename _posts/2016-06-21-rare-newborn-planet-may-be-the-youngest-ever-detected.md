  A distant, Neptune-size planet 500 light-years from Earth appears to be the
  youngest fully formed exoplanet ever found crossing its star, raising
  questions about how it formed so close, so quickly. Researchers first found
  the planet, which whisks around its star every five days, using the Kepler
  space telescope currently orbiting Earth.
