  The Martian is a love letter to science, but what does science think of The
  Martian? It's time for a report card on what's dead-on accurate, where the
  facts are fudged, and what's plausible for a future that could one day happen.
  Beware: Spoilers ahead. Plenty of spoilers. Constant spoilers.
