  The gray surfaces of the dwarf planet Ceres (the asteroid belt's largest
  resident) and Pluto's biggest moon, Charon, both show signs of containing
  forms of graphite, the material in pencil lead. When NASA's Dawn spacecraft
  arrived at Ceres last year to embark on an orbital survey, it found a gray,
  icy world covered with debris left behind by impacts.
