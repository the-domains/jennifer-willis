  Overall it's a very good movie, and while there are mistakes in it, it is the
  first genuine Mars movie. It is the first movie that attempts to be realistic
  and that is actually about human beings grappling with the problems of
  exploring Mars, as opposed to various movies set on Mars that are essentially
  either shoot 'em ups or horror films. It does not engage in fantasy: no
  monsters, no magic, no Nazis.
